BH FOSS would tell you how to route from a given system to your target objective and has some analytic queries built it for finding things you’d be interested in from the adversary perspective and how to take advantage of these paths.  BH Enterprise is designed to continuously map all attack paths and prioritize these into risks that teams can action.  BHE provides remediation information and a quantifiable measurement of the impact of the risk.  It also measures and monitors the environment over time."

We’re solving a totally different problem with BloodHound Enterprise, one that had to operate effectively in the largest environments.  This is something we wanted to solve with our design partners as we’ve been developing the product and have proven the product in environments with over 600k endpoints."

AD admins are given impractical guidance to implement least privilege and tiered administration. Mountains of misconfiugraiton debt pile up and continue to grow for years. Because the attack paths are invisible effectively for the defender the actual AD security posture is unknowable and no tangible progress can be made. Mathematically it is not possible to analyse every single attack path. What we can do is discover and measure what all of those attack paths have in common. What they all have in common are the last steps into Tier Zero. What we can do is identify and quantiy the most critical and common choke  points so you can take the least number of actions and the easiest actions that result in the reduction of the greatest number of attack paths possible. The net result of that is measurable security posture improvement within your existing architecture, without making fundamental changes to your Active Directory architecture. By focusing on choke points on all attack paths you can eliminate the greatest ammount of attack paths with the least ammount of effort. This precice, quantified, practical remediation guidance that enables rapid, measurable risk reduction is the methodology we call Attack Path Management."

That system needs 443 outbound to the Bloodhound Enterprise AWS instance and we provide customers with a specific URL to whitelist. We enumerate AD using a domain-joined Windows server.  This server issues LDAP queries to the DC and, if doing privileged collection, will attempt to enumerate all endpoints for local group and session information. That server streams the collected data over 443 (TLS 1.2 or higher) to the BHE instance assigned to your account.  This data is streamed as it’s collected, it’s not a bulk upload. Credentials are assigned on the data collection service (SharpHound Enterprise) within the Windows Server, you don’t put in credentials to BHE.  During the SharpHound Enterprise installation process, you’ll be prompted for the credentials to be used for scanning."
