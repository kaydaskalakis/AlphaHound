BH FOSS would tell you how to route from a given system to your target objective and has some analytic queries built it for finding things youâ€™d be interested in from the adversary perspective and how to take advantage of these paths.  BH Enterprise is designed to continuously map all attack paths and prioritize these into risks that teams can action.  BHE provides remediation information and a quantifiable measurement of the impact of the risk.  It also measures and monitors the environment over time."
